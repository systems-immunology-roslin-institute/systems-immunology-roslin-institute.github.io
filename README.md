Graphia is a powerful open-source visual analytics platform designed and developed to aid the interprretation of large and complex datasets. 

Graphia can create and visualise networks from any table of numeric or discrete data values and display the large and complex graph structures that result. It can also be used to visualise and analyse data that is already in the form of a network.

# Compatible Data Types

- **Biological** – protein interaction data, transcriptomics, single cell analyses, proteomics, metabolomics, multiparameter flow cytometry, genotyping data, medical imaging data,
- **Agri-tech** – data relating to the performance of animals, crops, farms, etc.
- **Fintech** – any numerical data relating to changing variables over time, e.g. share prices or categorical data relating to the attributes of commercial entities
- **Social media** – network connections between individuals, companies, etc.
- **Text mining** – count matrices of words found across many documents
- **Questionnaire** – answers to questions are categorical (yes/no) or continuous (1-10)

# Benefits

### Flexible workflows

**Many data types, many applications.**

Graphia works with two broad classes of data; Network data where connections between entities are already known, and Numerical data where Graphia will construct a correlation graph of any table of numerical values. As an open-source project, if it doesn’t already do what you want it to, you can adapt it to your own needs.

### Harnessing the power of visualisation

**Putting the analyst at the heart of the analysis**

When data is visualised in an intuitive and interactive manner, it allows the analyst the tackle certain problems whose size and complexity make them otherwise intractable. Graphia couples advanced computational algorithms with a visualisation interface that makes full use of the cognitive abilities of humans, providing deeper understanding and better communication of data.

### Easy to use interface  

**No programming skills required**

Graphia is designed to be usable by any analyst on any computational platform. Its intuitive graphical user interface means that powerful analytical algorithms and searches are just a click away! 

### Scalability

**Think big.**

The world is full of large and complex data and Graphia has been designed to work with it. Every aspect of the tool has been optimised for maximum speed and performance, so you don’t have to wait.


### Data deconvolution

**Ultrafast pattern finding**

Many analyses of complex data come down to a need to identify patterns and trends of interest. Graphia is designed to make this easy and quick by combining fast dynamic visualisations of data structure, with cluster analysis and the ability to explore the underlying data associated with the clusters observed.

 

### Data integration and connectivity

**Extensible to fit your needs**

Graphia provides a platform where different data types can be merged and explored as a graph, where connections or data attributes are derived from more than one source.  A plugin architecture enables the user interface may be modified to suit a given data type, connect with predefined data sources or optimised for a given analytical process, allowing a user to tailor it to suit its specific analytical needs.



## About

At Graphia we are passionate about graphs and visualisation as a powerful aid to data interpretation.  We want to be able to work with big data, to render it as a graph…..

Behind the tool are a small dedicated group of individuals working to make an analysis platform 

 

Graphia, designed and built by scientists working in Edinburgh, Scotland. 

 

Its open-source, its cool, its powerful and free for anyone to use.

 

## Working with us

There are lots of new features and functionality we still wish to add to Graphia and we can envisage the need to integrate it into local data infrastructures. If you are interested to work with us to further improve Graphia we would love to hear from you.
