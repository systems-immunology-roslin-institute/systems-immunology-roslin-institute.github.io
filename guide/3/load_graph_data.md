## Loading Graph Data

For an analysis to proceed, data needs to be presented to Graphia in one of the supported file formats.  Graphia will allow you to load any data in the right format, and it will quickly highlight any errors or issues with either the dataâ€™s format.  It is not uncommon that once explored, that data will need to be refined and then reloaded.
Graphia supports a wide range of data types derived from many sources, in this section we will deal with data that is already in a graph format and the tools available for its exploration and analysis.
If your data already has an obvious node and edge structure, i.e. relationships are already defined, we recommend formatting it into a graph-based file format.  For small datasets without attributes, pairwise (.txt) is a very simple format or if formatted as an adjacency matrix these can be loaded saved as (.csv, .tsv). For most other datasets, we recommend using one of the xml-based standard graph formats. 

Graphia supports the following graph-based file formats:
- Pairwise (.txt)
- JSON Graph (.json)
- GraphML (.graphml)
- Graph Modelling (.gml)
- Adjacency Matrix (.csv, .tsv)
- MATLAB data files [array] (.mat)

These files can be loaded directly into Graphia navigating to File > Open or by clicking the open icon in the top left of the toolbar.
