### A Short Introduction to Network Graphs
Many types of data of interest to scientists and commercial organisations alike, are best understood when represented and analysed as a network.  Fundamentally, networks are simple structures composed only of nodes, i.e. representing people, places, molecules or things, and edges, representing relationships between them. Whilst uncomplicated in form, networks can be usedas a powerful medium to understand big and complex data and systems. When data is visualised as a network, large amounts of information can be explored on a global or local scale.

For many reading this, network or graph-based analysis approaches may be relatively unfamiliar to you. The purpose of these pages is therefore to introduce you to various ideas and concepts of this approach to data analysis and demonstrate how this revolutionary software solution to graph analysis can be used. In so doing, we hope to be able to show you how graph analysis could allow you interact and understand your complex data in a completely different way.

There is often confusion between the terms, graph, plot and chart, which are frequently used interchangeably.  Plots and charts typically have two axes, with data plotted with as a line, bar or point, whilst in a mathematical sense graphs, also commonly called networks, are quite distinct.

Graphs are a means of describing any set of relationships or associations between people or things. For example, they can be used to represent communication networks, customer-client interactions, social media contacts, language structure, financial transactions, biological data and much more. The area of mathematics focused on graphs is known as graph theory and it is widely utilised to understand the structure of graphs.

Both nodes and edges are abstractions of real-world data. Nodes generally represent entities, while edges represent relationships between them. Each nodeor edge may be associated with additional information, called attribute or metadata, for example if a node represents a person, we might also know information on that individualâ€™s, age, gender, ethnicity, height, weight, diet, etc. Similarly, there many types of interactions between people and the direction, type, frequency or strength of an interaction can be considered as edge attributes. It is common to want to understand the structure of the relationships observed, in the context these data, e.g. do an observed grouping of individuals share a particular attribute or characteristic?

One of the best-known examples of a graph is the map of the London Underground. The now iconic representation of stations (nodes) and lines (edges), simplified travel and improved route-planning across the city for everyone.
