title: What type of data can I explore and analyse?
---

Many types of data are inherently a network of relationships, whether that be between companies and clients, relations between family members, communications between things or interactions between proteins. As such, thesedata types can all be visualised and explored as a network. These networks may be very big and our tools have been specifically designed to visualise and explore graphs composed of millions of nodes and edges.

Many other types of data take the form of a numerical table of measurements defined across many conditions or time points. Examples, include time-course data associated monitoring devices, share prices, the naming children, etc. or the result of gene or protein expression analysis across samples, questionnaire data or even present/absence scores. In this case, irrespective of origin or natureof the values, correlation network analysis may be used. Here each data series associated with one entity is compared to all others, and only the strongest correlations are plotted. This allows groups of entities exhibiting a similar behaviour to be easily identified, they form highly connected groups within the network, thereby allowing one to quickly spot major trends and patterns within data.
