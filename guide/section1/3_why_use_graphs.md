## Why use graphs for data analysis?

Graphs provide a fast and powerful medium with which to represent and explore many types of data or information. They can be used to simplify complex data, resolving complicated relationships into a much more navigable structure.  Compared to a traditional spreadsheet, graphs allow an analyst to easily spot trends and patterns in data without needing to ask if they are present. Graphs place the information at an analyst’s disposal; to visualise its form or structure, to ask the right questions and to draw the right conclusions about the data at hand.

Rendering data as graph, also allows an analyst to exploit their greatest asset, their innate ability to interpret the world through what they see, i.e. their cognitive skills.

As well as their visual appeal, converting your data to a graph allows you to leverage the entire mathematical field of graph theory. This renders a large toolkit of metrics and algorithms at your disposal.

Graphia’s unique functionality allows live analysis of large datasets in real time. It combines state-of-the-art data visualisation technologies with cutting edge graph analysis algorithms. Our graph-based analysis methods have been used in hundreds of publications, from cutting-edge genetic studies, to studies examining the trends in naming babies over many decades
