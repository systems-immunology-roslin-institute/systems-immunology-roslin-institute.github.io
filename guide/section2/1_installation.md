## Requirements

Graphia is platform independent and runs on Windows, MacOS or Linux operating systems. To get the most out of Graphia we recommend a dedicated graphics card

For analysis of big graphs we recommend the following or better:
- Quad-core CPU (Intel i5-4xxx / AMD FX6300 or greater)
- Dedicated Graphics Card (Nvidia GTX 960 / AMD R9 280X or greater)
- 16GB RAM

Graphia can run on less capable hardware, with small to medium sized graphs.  However, poor hardware may limit the amount of data that can be loaded, the size and speed at which a graph is rendered and fluidity of user interactions. 

You will also require a 3-button mouse, and more than one screen is not necessary but useful
